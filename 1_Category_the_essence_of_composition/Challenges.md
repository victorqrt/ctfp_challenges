## 4.
If we consider objects as web pages and morphisms as `<a>` links, then the www is not a category,
as there exists a pair of morphisms such as their composition does not exist: a page may link you
to another web page, but not contain all the links the latter contains.

## 5.
No, because of the same problem: if we consider friendships as morphisms, being friend with
someone does not imply being friend with its friends as well; no composablity.

## 6.
A directed graph is a category if and only if for each path between 3 nodes a->b->c there is
another edge going from a to c.
