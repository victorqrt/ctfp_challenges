### a)
The node is the only object, we only need to add one edge going from itself to itself to get its identity morphism.

### b)
We need to add infinitely many arrows from the node to itself to represent the compositions of the directed edge we started with.

### c)
Each node needs an edge from itself to itself for its identity morphism.

### d)
Assuming none of the marked arrows represent identity, we need to add it. Then we need to add every combination within the a-z alphabet, of every possible length.
This gives us infinetely many arrows from the node to itself.
